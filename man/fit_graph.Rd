\title{Fit the graph parameters to a data set.}
\usage{
fit_graph(data, graph, parameters = extract_graph_parameters(graph),
  optimisation_options = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data set.}

\item{graph}{The admixture graph.}

\item{parameters}{In case one wants to tweak something in the graph.}

\item{optimisation_options}{Options to the optimisation algorithm.}
}
\value{
A list containing the best fitted values (in an environment) and the
  data extended with a column containing the graph predictions.
}
\description{
Tries to minimize the squared distance between statistics in \code{data} and
statistics given by the graph.
}
\details{
The data frame, \code{data}, must contain columns \code{W}, \code{X},
\code{Y}, and \code{Z}. The function then computes the \eqn{f_4(W,X;Y,Z)}
statistics for all rows from these to obtain the prediction made by the
graph.

The data frame must also contain a column, \code{D}, containing the
statistics observed in the data. The fitting algorithm attempts to minimize
the distance from this column and the predictions made by the graph.
